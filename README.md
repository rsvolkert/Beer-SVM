# Beer-SVM

This is a project for a course that demonstrates use of Support Vector Machines in R. The data came from [https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans](https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans). I attempt to use support vector machines to predict types of beer based solely on ABV and IBUs.

The data cleaning occurs in *beersvm.R*, and *beer_presentation.Rmd* contains graphics to demonstrate the comparisons and results of the support vector machine. The conclusion is that the categories are too overlapping to effectively identify types of beer.

A repetition of this project in Python is in the works.
